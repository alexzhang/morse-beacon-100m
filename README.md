# Continuous-Phase FSK Modulator

LCM of 1200 and 2200 is 13200 Hz. 6-bit 132-sample sine wave.

Desired Frequency | Tick Rate | Steps | Advance Counter By
| :--- | --: | ---: | :---:
1200 Hz  | 13.2 kHz | 22 | 6
2200 Hz  | 13.2 kHz | 12 | 11

For better wave shape, use 26.4 kHz sample rate with 264 4-bit samples.
